Illustrations and animations of robotics concepts using Blender.
We build the Blender scenes using Python scripts as much of possible.

## Getting started :rocket:

After completing the installation, see the [scripts](./scripts/) folder for the available scripts.
Run them with Blender like so:

```
blender -P scripts/01_basics/01_ur5e.py
```


## Installation :cd:

First install [airo-blender](https://github.com/airo-ugent/airo-blender) and then the [urdf-workshop](https://github.com/Victorlouisdg/urdf-workshop).
Then clone the repo and run the scripts.
